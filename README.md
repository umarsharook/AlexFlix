# Netflix Clone (Frontend Only)

Netflix Clone is a front-end project that replicates the UI/UX design of Netflixâ€™s homepage using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”without any frameworks or back-end logic. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate mastery over:

Responsive layouts using CSS Flexbox/Grid

DOM manipulation using JavaScript

Data-driven UI rendering

Interactive elements like hover effects and click handlers

The homepage dynamically loads a list of popular movies and series using a hardcoded array of objects in JavaScript. Each movie card features:

A poster image (with fallback if the image is broken)

The movie title and description

A Play button that opens the trailer on YouTube

This project mimics the essential feel of Netflixâ€™s movie browser and can be extended with features like search, category filters, API integration (e.g., TMDB), and user authentication.


## ðŸŒŸ Features

- âœ… Movie and series posters arranged in a horizontal scroll
- âœ… Movie title displayed under each poster
- âœ… Hover zoom effect on posters (like Netflix)
- âœ… Responsive design for all screen sizes
- âœ… Play button on each poster â€” opens trailer in a new YouTube tab
- âœ… Fallback image if poster not found


##  Tech Stack

| Technology     | Purpose                      |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| **HTML5**       | Page structure               |
| **CSS3**        | Styling & responsive design  |
| **JavaScript (Vanilla)** | DOM manipulation, dynamic rendering |


## Folder Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ index.html    
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css       
â””â”€â”€ script.js



##  Getting Started

To set up and run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/umarsharook/AlexFlix-clone.git
````

2. **Navigate into the project folder**:

   ```bash
   cd netflix-clone
   ```

3. **Open the app**:

   * Open `index.html` with your browser
   * Or use **Live Server** in Visual Studio Code for auto reload

---

## How It Works

* All movie data (title, poster image, trailer URL) is stored in the `script.js` file as a JavaScript array.
* For each movie, the DOM dynamically creates:

  * An image (with hover zoom),
  * A title below the poster,
  * A "Play" button that opens the trailer on YouTube.
* If the image link fails, a default placeholder image is displayed.

## ðŸ§© Improvements to Make

Here are some ideas for extending the project:

* [ ] Add filter/search bar for movies
* [ ] Create multiple rows (Trending, Originals, etc.)
* [ ] Use real-time movie data using TMDB API
* [ ] Add login/signup UI page
* [ ] Implement backend using Firebase or Node.js
